Charpter 1: Breaking the Surface- a quick dip

Running a program means telling the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) to "Load the class",
then start executing its main() method, Keep running til all the code in main is 
finished.

Why does everything have to be in classes?
Java is an object-oriented language.

Do I have to put a main in every class I write?
No, only need one for the main method for the project start.

In my other language I can do a boolean test on an integer.
In Java can I say something like:
    int x = 1;
    while(x){}

No. A boolean and an integer are not compatible types in Java.

Charpter 2: A Trip to Objectville

Overriding just means that a subclass redefines one of its inherited
methods when it needs to change or extend the behavior of that method.

Things an object knows about itself are called -- instance variables
Things an object can do are called -- methods

A class is a blueprint for an object

The two uses of main:
to test your real class
to launch/start your Java application

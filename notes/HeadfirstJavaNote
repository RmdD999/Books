Charpter 1: Breaking the Surface- a quick dip

Running a program means telling the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) to "Load the class",
then start executing its main() method, Keep running til all the code in main is 
finished.

Why does everything have to be in classes?
Java is an object-oriented language.

Do I have to put a main in every class I write?
No, only need one for the main method for the project start.

In my other language I can do a boolean test on an integer.
In Java can I say something like:
    int x = 1;
    while(x){}

No. A boolean and an integer are not compatible types in Java.
